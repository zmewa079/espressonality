# Espressonality
## Objective
+ Build a full stack application where the user can store and collect their favorite cafes. 
+ Users will be able to navigate to a page where the cafe collection is held.
 + Users will be able to click on a specific cafe which will give them details about the cafe. 
+ Users will be able to view and add cafe reviews to each cafe added or have been previously added.
